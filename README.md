# Setup
1) *install latest Xcode including command line tools*

2) *For best results, run in simulator with target OS as **iOS 10.2** and target device as the **iPhone 7***

3) *have fun*

Note: Users created on the desktop ROR site can also authenticate into the iOS application with the same credentials. Both use https://basic-app.herokuapp.com/ as the back-end.
